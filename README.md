This is a port of the original polution solutions mod to factorio 2.0.  
its a very simple port and largley untested so expect issues and report them, i am aware of some sprite alignment issues but i cannot be bothered to fix them so if it really bugs someone submit a PR fixing them and ill merge it.  
ive not added space age support or anything like that so use at your own risk
